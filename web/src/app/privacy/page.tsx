      </p>

      <h2>4. Audio recordings — who is responsible for what</h2>
      <p>
        Coaches use the Service to record audio of lessons and notes.
        Responsibility is shared as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The coach decides who and what to record</strong> and is
          responsible for having the consent of the people captured in a
          recording (including, for a child, their parent or guardian), as set
          out in our <Link href="/terms">Terms of Service</Link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We (InBetween)</strong> are responsible for processing and{" "}
          <strong>securely storing</strong> those recordings and the resulting
          transcriptions, and for the integrity and confidentiality of that data
          once it is in the Service. Access to transcriptions is restricted to
          InBetween's systems and the relevant account(s); we do not sell this
          data or use it for advertising.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have been recorded and have questions or want a recording reviewed
        or deleted, contact the coach who recorded you and/or us at
        hello@useinbetween.com.
      </p>

      <h2>5. AI processing</h2>
      <p>
        To turn audio into transcriptions and focus points, we share the relevant
        content with AI and transcription providers acting as our processors (see
        section 6). These providers handle the content{" "}
        <strong>only to perform that task for us</strong>, under contract. We use
        their services through their business/API offerings and do not permit
        them to use your content for their own purposes; for details of how each
        provider handles data, please see that provider's own terms and privacy
        policy. AI-generated transcriptions and summaries can contain mistakes and
        should not be treated as definitive.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Who we share data with (our processors)</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We share it only with service
        providers who process it on our behalf, under contract, to run the
        Service:

        We may also disclose data if required by law, to protect our rights, or
        in connection with a corporate transaction (e.g. a merger), in which case
        we will tell you.
      </p>

      <h2>7. International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your account data and files are hosted in the <strong>EU (Ireland)</strong>.
        Some of our providers (notably our AI, transcription, notification,
        email, analytics, and advertising providers) are based in the{" "}
        <strong>United States</strong>, so some data is transferred outside the
        UK/EEA. Where we make such transfers, we
        put appropriate safeguards in place, such as the{" "}
        <strong>UK International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum</strong> and
        the <strong>EU Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>, or we rely on an
        applicable adequacy decision. You can ask us for more detail about these
        safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
      <p>Under the UK and EU GDPR you have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>access</strong> the personal data we hold about you;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>rectify</strong> inaccurate or incomplete data;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>erase</strong> your data ("right to be forgotten");
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>restrict</strong> or <strong>object</strong> to certain
          processing (including processing based on legitimate interests);
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>data portability</strong> (receive your data in a portable
          format);
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we rely on consent
          (e.g. waitlist emails);
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>not be subject</strong> to solely automated decisions with
          legal or similarly significant effects (we do not make such decisions).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise any of these rights, email{" "}
        <strong>hello@useinbetween.com</strong>. We will respond within one
        month. You will not normally have to pay a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also have the right to complain to a data protection authority. In
        the UK this is the{" "}
        <strong>Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)</strong> — ico.org.uk. In
        the EU/EEA you can complain to your local supervisory authority.
      </p>

      <h2>9. How long we keep your data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We keep your account and content for as long as your account is active.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you delete your account, we delete your personal data within{" "}
          <strong>30 days</strong>, and remove it from routine backups within{" "}
          <strong>90 days</strong>, except where we must keep certain information
          to comply with the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          As this is a <strong>private beta</strong>, all beta data may be
          deleted when the beta ends. We will give reasonable notice before doing
          so.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can ask us to delete your data sooner at any time (section 8).
      </p>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your
        data, including encryption in transit, access controls, and restricting
        access to transcriptions to our systems. No method of transmission or
        storage is completely secure, but we work to protect your data and will
        notify you and the relevant authority of a personal-data breach where the
        law requires.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Children</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is for users aged <strong>13 and over</strong>. If you are
        under the age of digital consent in your country (13 in the UK; 13–16 in
        the EU/EEA depending on the country), you may only use the Service with
        the consent of a parent or guardian. If you believe a child has provided
        us with personal data without the required consent, contact us at
        hello@useinbetween.com and we will delete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coaches who record children in lessons are responsible for obtaining
        parental/guardian consent (see section 4 and the Terms).
      </p>

      <h2>12. Cookies and our website</h2>
      <p>Our app does not use advertising or tracking cookies.</p>
      <p>
        Our website (useinbetween.com), where you join the waitlist, uses a few
        additional services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          essential cookies needed to run the site, and <strong>Resend</strong>{" "}
          to manage waitlist sign-ups and emails;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vercel Web Analytics</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Vercel Speed Insights</strong> — privacy-friendly, cookieless
          analytics that measure traffic and page performance without tracking
          you across other sites;
        </li>
        <li>
          the <strong>Meta Pixel</strong>, which uses cookies to measure visits
          and waitlist sign-ups so we can understand and improve our advertising
          on Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram).
        </li>
      </ul>

        You can opt out of advertising cookies at any time through your browser

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material
        changes, we will take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, in the
